# Ansible playbooks

A collection of Ansible playbooks for various tasks with learning purposes. For these playbooks, I use Vagrant to create a virtual machine and test the playbooks. Many of these exercises are based on the book [Ansible: Up and Running](https://www.ansible.com/resources/ebooks/ansible-up-and-running).
